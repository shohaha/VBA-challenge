# VBA Bootcamp Asssignment - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Instructions

The purpose of this assignment was to create a script in Visual Basic Application to capture loops through all stock data for one year including the following information:

  1. The ticker symbol
  2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  3. Percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  4. The total stock volume of the stock 

_Instructions suggest to use conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative in red, however, this function was built-in to the code so no conditional formatting was used to achieve the desired result._

## Bonus

This part of the assignment was to add functionality to the script to return the stock with the **Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and Greatest Total Volume** which should run on every worksheet to include every year running the script once.
